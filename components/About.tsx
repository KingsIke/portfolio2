                    I'm also known as KINGS=IKE!, a Junior Full Stack Developer.
                    I've been coding for about 3 years now. As a Full Stack developer, I've worked on-site and remotely both as an Internships and Associate Developer with startups and large companies, to help build & scale their vision and mission. Along my journey, I realized my passion existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams as upcoming developersðŸŽ–. With this passion, I know that am going to make an impact in my community and across the globe at large.
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have undergone trainings in soft skills on Agile methodology using scrum,jira for Effective communication, teamwork,time management and emotional intelligence. I understand the importance of these skills in fostering a positive and productive work environment. Also not forgetting am a programmer with passion for bodybuilding, fashion design, swimming, and music. These hobbies allow me to showcase my creativity, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and unwind from the demands of my workðŸ¥‡.
